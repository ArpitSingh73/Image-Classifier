Steps to model creation --->

(1) Since I had no data required for the model creation and I was unable to download
    the pre-stored dataset so, I created my own small data by downloading each images by my own.

(2) Once the images were downloaded I then stored all of them in a list and
    labelled them.

(3) After labelling of images I converted the list of images and labels in to a
    Numpy array/vectors so that our machine learning model can understand the input 

(4) Since all of the images were manually downloaded and labelled, so I had not perform any
    data preprocessing.     

(5) Then I chose to go with Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm to develop my
    model.

(6) At the end I trained my model with 80% of the data I had. I got about highest of 91% accuracy.

(6) Done.
